# HFLUX
HFLUX is a one-dimensional transient model that calculates stream temperatures with respect to space and time using the mass and energy balance equations for temperature transport in streams. It uses initial spatial and temporal temperature boundary conditions, stream dimension information, discharge data, and meteorological data to calculate stream temperature using a finite difference method. HFLUX is written as a set of functions that run in the MATLAB environment. More information can be found in the HFLUX Documentation.  The zip file contains the MATLAB code, the data input template, documentation describing the functionality of HFLUX and a sample data set. The codes are also archived on Hydroshare at https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/71415cf96d614e208c201c1153034a49/
